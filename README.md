## **Git**
> Git is "a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people" [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

All you really need to know is that it allows for multiple people to work on a project, while also providing many benefits such as tracking changes in the code.
